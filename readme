# Project Name 
  SVG logo maker 
  
  


## Description
For this project I had to use jest and inquire to create a dynamic svg logo maker. Then also created passing test for each shape. Which i have done correctly to successfully create a shape (square, circle, triangle) any three letters you would like, and any color for the shape and text. Ive learned how to  implement inquire and run test to help solve bugs and even typos. I also learned how to use code for other reasons than just a web browser.
